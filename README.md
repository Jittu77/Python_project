# Python_project
this is my first respository

this repositories contains a list of problems(with solution) with gradually increasing difficulty levels that can help students in learning Python programming in a systematic way. The problems are chosen such that they are related to basic math so that there can be a better appreciation for the task and the solution.

Topics:
